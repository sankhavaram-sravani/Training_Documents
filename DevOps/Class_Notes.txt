		- Continuous Delivery & Deployment :::		

			- Both Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment and used to release the changes to Production Environment.
			
			- Continuous Delivery: 
			
				-> This process expect manual intervension/approval for production releases 
				-> During the process of application upgrade or downgrade, there might be application downtime
				-> This is used for Monolith Application Architecture
			
				
				Eg.: Insurance/Logistics/Stock-Markets/
				
					Banking Application :
				
					Online NetBanking/Credit Card Transactions
					
						- Open a Production Release Window - 4Hrs - 6Hrs 
						
							Fix the Issue, else revert.


						
			- Continuous Deployment:
				
				-> This process does not expect any manual approval/intervension for production releases
				-> We can perform application upgrade or downgrade without any downtime 
				-> Zero Downtime can be achieved using Micro-Service based Application Architecture
				-> Considered as Matured Level of DevOps!
				
				
				Eg.: Netflix/Facebook/Amazon.com
				
			
			www.amazon.com :
			
			Sign-Up			--> Micro-Service1 -> Developer1 -> Independently Code,Test -> promote the Changes for further Testing - Release to Prod.
			Sign-In 		--> Micro-Service2 -> Developer2 -> Independently Code,Test -> promote the Changes for further Testing - Release to Prod.

	- User & Access Management :::::
	
	
		Create Linux User :

		SSH Connection :	Secure SHell Connection 
		
			-> Host Name 
			-> User Name 
			-> User Authentication 


			-> Authentication Types :
			
				- Password Based Authentication
				
				- Key Based Authentication
					- Public Key 
					- Private Key 
					- authorized keys




		How to Create Linux User ?
		
			Username : devopsadmin 
			
			Bash Terminal Access :
			
			Home Dir :
			
			password :
			
			ssh-keys :



		Create Linux User with SSH Keys :::
		
			sudo -i 
			
			useradd devopsadmin -s /bin/bash -m -d /home/devopsadmin

			su - devopsadmin

			ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521					#ubuntu 22.04 or higher version of ubuntu				

			cd .ssh
			
			ls ~/.ssh 

			#You should see following two files:

			#id_ecdsa - private key
			#id_ecdsa.pub - public
			
			
			cat id_ecdsa.pub > authorized_keys			# authorized_keys this file name should be same.
			
			authorized_keys :::
				It is the copy of Public Key.
				
				Always the private key will be compared with the authorized_keys
				
			chmod 600 /home/devopsadmin/.ssh/*					# Used to Change the Access Mode of Files or Directories


		Create Password to any Linux User:
		
			As a root user ::
			
				passwd <user_name>
				
				passwd devopsadmin


		Get the List of Linux Users ::::
			cat /etc/passwd
		
		Get the list of Linux User Groups :::: 
			cat /etc/group


	
		Add user to a Group :
		
			usermod -aG <Existing_Group_Name> <Existing_User_Name>
			
			usermod -aG docker devopsadmin


		Change the Ownership of any dir/file :::		
			
			chown -R devopsadmin /opt/tomcat/		# Used to Change the Ownership of Files or Directories

	- Remote Servers Management 
	- Process Automation(Shell Scripting)


######################
Day 7: 11th Dec. 2025
######################


	- Remote Servers Management :::
	
		Jenkins,Docker,Kubernetes,Ansible,Terraform,Prometheus
		
			- Client-Server Architecture:
			
				Server(VM) ---> Client1(VM),2,3,4,5
	
	- Remote Servers Management :::		for Client/Server Architecture.
	
		VM1 
		
		VM2 
		
		Environments :
		
			Dev Environment (VM1)
			
			Build Environment --> Application Build ==> *.war 
			 
			QA (VM1) *.war 
			
			UAT (VM1) *.war 
			
			Prod (VM1) *.war 

Use Case :

		1. Establish Connection to Remote Server  
		2. Login to the Remote Server 
		3. Copy the Files from one server to another server
			using SCP
		4. Manage the Remote Server - Install any package/Uninstall/Upgrade 
		
		
		Pre-requisites for Remote Server :::
		
			- Launch 2 VMs (VM1-Source & VM2-Target)
			
			- Ensure that Port 22 is enabled 
			
			- Create User in both the VMs 
			
			- Create SSH-Key in one server(VM1)
					ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521
					
			- Use the public_Key as a authorized_keys in the target server(VM2)
			
			- Establish SSH Connection & Login to VM2(Target_Machine)
			
			- Copy Files from VM1 to VM2(Target_Machine)
	
		Server1 --> 
		
			-> Authentication : Tells who can access the Server 	
			
			-> Authorization : Tells what can be done on that Server

Source Machine :::

		Create Linux User with SSH Keys :::
		
			sudo -i 
			
			useradd devopsadmin -s /bin/bash -m -d /home/devopsadmin

			su - devopsadmin

			ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521					#ubuntu 22.04 or higher version of ubuntu				

			cd .ssh
			
			ls ~/.ssh 

			#You should see following two files:

			#id_ecdsa - private key
			#id_ecdsa.pub - public
			

			
Client_Machine ::::

		- Create User :::
			
				useradd adminuser1 -s /bin/bash -m -d /home/adminuser1

				su - adminuser1					

			- Use the public_Key as a authorized_keys in the target server(VM2) :::

				mkdir .ssh 

				cd .ssh 


				vi authorized_keys

				#paste the id_ecdsa.pub of devopsadmin user from Server machine to authorized_keys file in Client Machine 

				chmod 600 /home/adminuser1/.ssh/*


			- Establish SSH Connection & Login to VM2(Target_Machine)

					ssh adminuser1@172.31.0.239			# Using Private IP Address
								
			- Copy Files from VM1 to VM2(Target_Machine)
			

				#cp  /home/devopsadmin/sourcefile.txt home/devopsadmin/dir1/
		
				 scp /home/devopsadmin/sourcefile.txt adminuser1@172.31.0.239:/home/adminuser1

	
	
	- Process Automation(Shell Scripting) 
	
	
-> Pre-requisites ::::

			Scripting Languages ?
				- Are used to perform some process automation/validations
				- Light-weight 
				- Eg.: java scripts / shell scripts / yaml script / groovy / python 
					(vs)
			Progamming Language ?
				- Are used to create some business applications 
				- Huge Collection of Programming components
				- Eg.: Java/.Net Framework/Python/Ruby/Cobol/C
				
			
			Shell Scripting Language :
			
				- Shell Scripting is a collection shell commands 
				- Shell Script file should be saved as *.sh (Extention should be .sh)
		
		
		
	
	==> Data ::: ???
	
	What is data ??
	
		- Raw fact/text : Without any meaning!
		
			INDIA ? PYHJUNEMSO
		
	What is Information ??
	
		- Processed Data!
		
			INDIA is Country !
	
	
	Progamming Language/ Scripting Language ::::
	
		Variable/Identifier:
		
			x = 5;
			y = "Hi"
			
		Data Types :
		
			int z = 5;
			
			String stud_ID = "1001";
			
		Array :
			String stud_ID[5] = {"1001","1002","1003","1004","1005"};
									0	   1	  2		 3		4
					
			stud_ID[4] = "1005"
			
			stud_ID[5] = ?
			
		Looping :
		
			for loop 
			
			while loop 
			
			do while 
			
		
			Accept Stud_Name - 123123123
			
		Conditional Statements:
		
			IF statements 
			
			Switch Case Statements
			
		
		Operators :
		
			Store the data?
			
		File System ::
		
			- file handling concepts :
			
				- Create/Write/Read/Update/Delete 
				
		Relational Data :::
		
			-> RDBMS - -- SQL/ORACLE
			
		Remote Service calls 
				
				
				
	Shell Scripts to Implement DevOps Process Automation/Solutions :::
	
		- Automate the Infra-Structure Configurations
		
		- Automate the Application Deployments 
		
		- Automate the Remote Server Management :
					- Security Patches 
					- Upgrade

		- Automate the Application Data Back-up & Restore
